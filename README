transabs
========

Electron nano-plasma driven by an IR laser pulse. Records spatio-temporal
charge distributions for postprocessing with atomic structure code. Python
glue.

Header names are more or less self-explanatory.

main.cpp : option processing with boost, main driver.

Statistics.cpp records all density distributions and writes them in an HDF5 file.

DirectSum.cpp computes all Coulombic forces in standard all pairs way. No tree-code here.
